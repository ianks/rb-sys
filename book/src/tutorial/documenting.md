# Documenting

Generating documentation for your Ruby project is easy with [YARD](https://yardoc.org/). Unfortunately, YARD doesn't
support documenting Rust code. But don't worry! The [`yard-rustdoc`][yard-rustdoc] gem can generate documentation for
your Rust code and include it in your YARD documentation.

Check out the [getting started guide][guide] to learn how to use `yard-rustdoc`.
