# Rust ❤️ Ruby

This book describes how to use [Rust][] to build fast, reliable and secure native gems for Ruby. You may be new to Rust,
and that's OK! You'll find that Rust has many of the things you love about Ruby. And unlike C, incorrect code will
usually fail at compile time rather than bringing down production.

By the end of this book, you will be confident to build, test, and deploy a Rusty Ruby gem of your own!

Let's get started by learning about [how native Ruby gems work](./background-and-concepts.html).
