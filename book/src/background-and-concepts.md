# Background and Concepts

## World's Simplest Rust Extension

To illustrate how native extensions work, we are going to create the simplest possible native extension for Ruby. This
is only to show the core concepts of how native extensions work under the hood.

```rust
// simplest_rust_extenion.rs

// Define the libruby functions we need so we can use them (in a real gem, rb-sys would do this for you)
extern "C" {
    fn rb_define_global_function(name: *const u8, func: extern "C" fn() -> usize, arity: isize);
    fn rb_str_new(ptr: *const u8, len: isize) -> usize;
}

extern "C" fn hello_from_rust() -> usize {
    unsafe { rb_str_new("Hello, world!".as_ptr(), 12) }
}

// Initialize the extension
#[no_mangle]
unsafe extern "C" fn Init_simplest_rust_extension() {
    rb_define_global_function("hello_from_rust\0".as_ptr(), hello_from_rust, 0);
}
```

Then, it's a matter of compiling and running like so:

```sh
$ rustc --crate-type=cdylib simplest_rust_extension.rs -o simplest_rust_extension.bundle -C link-arg="-Wl,-undefined,dynamic_lookup"

$ ruby -r ./simplest_rust_extension -e "puts hello_from_rust" #=> "Hello, world!"
```

## What is a native extension?

Typically, Ruby code is compiled to a special instruction set which executes on a stack-based virtual machine. You can
see what these instructions look like by running:

```sh
$ ruby --dump=insns -e '2 + 3'
== disasm: #<ISeq:<main>@-e:1 (1,0)-(1,5)> (catch: FALSE)
0000 putobject         2           (   1)[Li]
0002 putobject         3
0004 opt_plus          <calldata!mid:+, argc:1, ARGS_SIMPLE>[CcCr]
0006 leave
```

In this example, `2` and `3` are pushed onto the stack, and then `opt_plus` performs the addition.

For a native gem, we bypass this mechanism entirely and instead expose native machine code to Ruby. In our native code,
we can use the [Ruby C API] to interact with the Ruby VM.

## How are native Gems loaded?

Under the hood, native extensions are compiled as shared libraries (`.so`, `.bundle`, etc.). When you
`require 'some_gem'`, if Ruby finds a `some_gem.(so|bundle|lib)`, the shared library loaded on demand using [dlopen] (or
the system equivalent). After that, Ruby will call `Init_some_gem` so the native library can do its magic.

## Why does it work with Rust and not other languages?

C is often referred to as the "lingua franca" of the programming language world, and Rust is fluent. Rust can compile
functions to be compatible with the C calling conventions, and align items in memory in a way that C understands. Rust
also does not have a garbage collector, which makes integration significantly easier.

When Ruby loads a gem extension written in Rust, it has no idea the gem is actually written in Rust. Due to Rust's
robust C FFI, you can code anything in Rust that you could with C.
