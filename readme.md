The primary goal of `rb-sys` is to make building native Ruby extensions in Rust **easier** than it would be in C. If
it's not easy, it's a bug.

- [Battle-tested **Ruby FFI bindings** ](./crates/rb-sys/readme.md) for Rust (via `rb-sys` crate)
- [Ruby gem for **compiling extensions**](./gem/README.md)
- [GitHub action][setup-action] to **setup a test environment in CI**
- [GitHub action][cross-gem-action] to easily **cross compile in CI**
- [**Test helpers**)][test-helpers] for testing Ruby extensions in Rust

## Features

- Battle-tested Rust bindings for [the Ruby C API][ruby-c-api]
- Support for Ruby 2.4+
- Supports all major platforms (Linux, macOS, Windows)
- Cross compilation of gems
- Integration with [`rake-compiler`][rake-compiler]

## Usage

Below are some examples of how to use `rb-sys` to build native Rust extensions. Use these as a starting point for your
building your own gem.

- The [`wasmtime-rb`][wasmtime-rb] gem uses `rb-sys` and [`magnus`][magnus] to package the rust [`wasmtime`][wasmtime]
  library as a Ruby gem.
- The [`oxi-test` gem][oxi-test] is the canonical example of how to use `rb-sys`. It is a minimal, fully tested with
  GitHub actions, and cross-compiles native gem binaries. This should be your first stop for learning how to use
  `rb-sys`.
- [Docs for the `rb_sys` gem][rb-sys-gem-docs] and using it with an `extconf.rb` file.
- The [`magnus` repo has some solid examples][magnus-examples].
- This [demo repository][rust-talk] that @ianks made for a talk has a gem which has 4 native extensions in the `ext`
  directory.
- This [PR for the `yrb` gem][yrb] shows how to integrate `rb-sys` and [`magnus`][magnus] into an existing gem.
- A [guide for setting debug breakpoints in VSCode][debugging-guide] is available.

## Supported Toolchains

- Ruby: <!--toolchains .policy.minimum-supported-ruby-version -->2.4<!--/toolchains-->+ (for full compatibility with
  Rubygems)
- Rust: <!--toolchains .policy.minimum-supported-rust-version -->1.60<!--/toolchains-->+

## Supported Platforms

We support cross compilation to the following platforms (this information is also available in the [`./data`](./data)
directory for automation purposes):
