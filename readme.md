The primary goal of `rb-sys` is to make building native Ruby extensions in Rust **easier** than it would be in C. If
it's not easy, it's a bug.

- [Rust bindings (`rb-sys` crate)](./crates/rb-sys/readme.md)
- [Ruby gem for compiling extensions](./gem/readme.md)

## Features

- [GitHub action](https://github.com/oxidize-rb/cross-gem-action) to easily cross compile in CI
- Integration with [rake-compiler](https://github.com/rake-compiler/rake-compiler)
- Cross compilation of gems
- Auto-generated Rust bindings for libruby classes
