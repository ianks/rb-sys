Autogenerated Rust bindings for Ruby. Uses the [`rust-bindgen`](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust-bindgen) crate to
generate bindings from the `ruby.h` header.https://github.com/rust-lang/rust-bindgen

## ⚠️ Notice

This is a very low-level library. If you are looking to write a gem in Rust, you should probably use
https://github.com/matsadler/magnus crate, with the `rb-sys-interop` feature.

If you actually _need_ raw/unsafe bindings to libruby, the this crate if for you!

## Usage

1. Add the following to your `Cargo.toml`:

   ```toml
   [dependencies]
   rb-sys = "0.9"
   ```

2. [See this example of creating a Ruby gem in Rust](./examples/rust_reverse)

### Linking libruby

If you need to link libruby (i.e. you are initializing a Ruby VM in your Rust code), use can enable the `link-ruby`
feature:

```rust
rb-sys = { version = "0.9",  features = ["link-ruby"] }
```

If you are authoring a Ruby gem, you do not need to enable this feature.

### Static libruby

You can also force static linking of libruby:

```rust
rb-sys = { version = "0.9", features = ["ruby-static"] }
```

Alternatively, you can set the `RUBY_STATIC=true` environment variable.

## Ruby Macros

The `rb-sys` crates comes with an optional [`ruby-macros` feature](./crates/rb-sys/src/macros/mod.rs). This feature
compiles a small bit of C code to give access to some commonly used C macros in Ruby.

```toml
# Cargo.toml

[dependencies]
rb-sys = { version = "0.9",  features = ["ruby-macros"] }
```

### Other features

- `gem`: Setup boilerplate for a Ruby gem (enabled by default).
- `ruby-abi-version`: Set the Ruby ABI version. (enabled by default).
- `ruby-macros`: Generate Rust functions for Ruby macros like `RSTRING_PTR` (enabled by default).
- `global-allocator`: Report Rust memory allocations to the Ruby GC (_recommended_).
- `ruby-static`: Link the static version of libruby.
- `link-ruby`: Link libruby.
- `bindgen-rbimpls`: Include the Ruby impl types in bindings.
- `bindgen-deprecated-types`: Include deprecated Ruby methods in bindings.
