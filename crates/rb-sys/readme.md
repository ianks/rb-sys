Autogenerated Rust bindings for Ruby. Uses the [`rust-bindgen`](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust-bindgen) crate to
generate bindings from the `ruby.h` header.https://github.com/rust-lang/rust-bindgen

## Usage

1. Add the following to your `Cargo.toml`:

   ```toml
   [dependencies]
   rb-sys = "0.9"
   ```

2. [See this example of creating a Ruby gem in Rust](./examples/rust_reverse)

### Linking libruby

If you need to link libruby (i.e. you are initializing a Ruby VM in your Rust code), use can enable the `link-ruby`
feature:

```rust
rb-sys = { version = "0.9",  features = ["link-ruby"] }
```

### Static libruby

You can also force the `link-ruby` feature to be static:

```rust
rb-sys = { version = "0.9", features = ["link-ruby", "ruby-static"] }
```

Alternatively, you can set the `RUBY_STATIC=true` environment variable.
